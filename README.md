# Scrap Yard

This is a static site distribution tool.

It uses [ledger](https://github.com/kholbekj/ledger) to facilitate P2P discovery and sharing of static sites.

It can download site files, or serve the site directly from the page.

This is meant as an alternative relying on a host in order to access static web content, meaning p2p applications can be distributed relying only on a signalling endpoint for WebRTC discovery, as well as a potential curation tool.
